## About the Project

I just discoverd a "new" game engine that looks interesting to me, so I thought "I want to build a game with it".
 
*Please note that I am new at this Game Development stuff. :)<br/>


## Getting Started

1. You need Haxe
    * First you need to install Haxe so go to their [page]("https://haxe.org/") and install Haxe

2. You need git (but i think you can do that without me..)

3. Install the Luxe engine
    * Write into the Commandline `haxelib install snowfall`
    * after that run `haxelib run snowfall update luxe`
    * To test if it installed snowfall properly type `haxelib run snowfall test luxe`
    * If no error occurred go ahead with `haxelib run snowfall shortcuts` (OPTIONAL)
        * This is a optional step. Its for shortcuts so you dont need to write every time before `flux`, or `snowfall` the annoying `haxelib run`.

Now you installed Luxe. You will need one more dependency its called `hxcpp` to install it just type `haxelib install hxcpp`.

To run this project you need to clone it (obviously). Open a terminal in the Project folder and run `flow build` to build it. If you want to build and run it just type `flow run` it will now build and run after the Build, but if you want to launch it without building it it would be `flow launch`.

Now you can run this project.. Have fun.
